      Hello, I am Muhammad. And this video is about project number one of
      CISW306 course. This assignment includes CSS and HTML files and some
      photos. The website was built with the help of HTML 5 and CSS 3 and has
      different sections. From top to bottom: header and title, navigation bar,
      introduction section, career and educational goals, hobbies and favorite
      things, reminder of the 4 accessibility keys. , a section to play this
      video and finally a footer. There are several photos on the website, all
      of which have a free license and can be used legally for commercial,
      educational or personal purposes. I have to remind you that,
      unfortunately, YouTube's iframe does not work on VS Code's live server.
      But if the codes are uploaded on a real host, there will be no problem and
      you can easily watch the video file. The readme file is available.
